                            Completed a 6-month internship as a Java Developer at Aswath Software Pvt. Ltd. (Dec 2024 - May 2025). During this period, I actively contributed to designing, developing, and testing backend modules using <strong>Spring Boot</strong> and <strong>RESTful APIs</strong>. I worked with <strong>Postman</strong> to validate API endpoints, integrated continuous deployment pipelines using <strong>Jenkins</strong>, and collaborated with team members through <strong>GitHub</strong> for version control and code reviews. This internship helped me strengthen my understanding of <strong>object-oriented programming</strong>, <strong>database connectivity</strong> (MySQL), and <strong>agile development practices</strong>. I also participated in debugging sessions, performance optimization, and deployment processes, gaining practical insights into the complete software development lifecycle.
